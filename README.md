## Python Developer 🐍

### Hey, I'm Federico Gomez 👋

I'm a **backend developer** from Argentina. 🌎  
Actually, I am working at [**Grupo Ward**](https://grupoward.com) as a full stack developer. 🖥️  
I made many backend apps with FastAPI, Django and Django Rest Framework.  
My most important projects are available here. You can find some CRUD apps and more complex apps. 🧠  
The better repositories are **pinned** 👇👇

```json
{
    "skills": [
        { "Python": [ "FastAPI", "Django", "Django Rest Framework" ] },
        { "database": [ "MongoDB", "MySQL", "PostgreSQL" ] },
        { "Javascript": [ "React JS" ] }
    ]
}
